# MyNumber game
This is the first game I made myself

No examples on the Internet or as a tutorial on YouTube so I had to figure out for myself how to solve the functionality of this game.

The idea for this game is from the popular TV quiz Slagalica https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_HsEBxSEn2M/hqdefault.jpg.

# Explanation
  My number is a game of numbers and computation.
   The computer randomly selects one target number from 1 to 999, as well as 6 smaller numbers. These 6 numbers should be combined with mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to get the target number.
